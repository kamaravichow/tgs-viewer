### TGS file format:

The file format determines how the data is stored in the file. The initial characters of a file are called signature, sometimes also "magic bytes". The signature can be used to infer the file format. Nonetheless, different programs can utilize the same file extension to represent distinct file formats. Double-clicking on the file often results in an error when opening. So a detailed analysis of a file is vital in order to determine the format and the associated program. Below you will find our evaluation of the TGS files:

TGS is a very widely used file extension. The file type is used by different programs with different formats. However, the following two file formats are common:

50% of all TGS files are Telegram Animated Stickers files. These files are plain text, which means they can be viewed with any text editor such as Windows Editor, Nano for Linux, and TextEdit for macOS. The files are 60 KB to 280 KB in size, with a median of 150 KB. A number of words can almost always be found in the files, e.g. layers, assets, parent and comp_0. Files like these are sometimes connected to sticker, animated, telegraph, stickers, data, messenger, telegram, android, primary and cache.
45% of all TGS files are associated with Telegram Animated Stickers files, which internally utilize the well-known GZIP format. Gzip is a compressed archive file format. Gzip (GNU zip) is only capable to compress a single file. These are binary files, so they do not contain words or text. A typical file size is 17 KB. Examples of file names are AnimatedSticker.tgs or 0.tgs. Such TGS files store data about factor, monkey, setup, close, animoji and peek.
